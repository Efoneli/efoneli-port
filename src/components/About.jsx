              Hi. I'm Abba Efoneli Sarah, nice to meet you. Please take a look
              around.
            </p>

              I'm a Frontend Developer with 3+ years of experience specializing in Next.js, ReactJs, and NestJS. My focus is on building high-performance, scalable web applications with a strong emphasis on user experience and accessibility.
              <br /> I&apos;ve worked with fintech companies to develop content-driven platforms, including dashboards and responsive user interfaces, enhancing performance and user engagement. My toolkit also includes Tailwind CSS for efficient styling and GitHub for collaborative workflows.
              <br />
              I thrive on solving problems, optimizing for SEO, and delivering pixel-perfect designs. Beyond coding, I stay current with tech trends, contribute to open-source projects, and enjoy experimenting with new design patterns.
              <br />
              Iâ€™m eager to bring my skills to a team where I can take ownership of frontend projects and contribute to building impactful digital experiences.
